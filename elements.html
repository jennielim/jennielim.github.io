									<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"> To Whom It May Concern: </p>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">I am honored to recommend Jennie Lim for your company. I was Jennie's supervisor when she worked in the Law School Admissions Office at the University of Minnesota. </p>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We hired Jennie, after receiving many applications for the position, because of her outstanding poise and professionalism in the interview. Her professionalism did not waiver during her employment with our office. We knew we could depend on Jennie to be on time and complete each task we assigned her with spectacular attention to detail. </p>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We quickly realized that Jennie would also be a great representative of the Law School for prospective graduate students. Many of them would call or office or want to visit and Jennie would be the first person that they would talk to when they called or stopped by the office. We knew they would be welcomed to our office appropriately when Jennie was working.</p>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Jennie helped our office manage a large applicant pool and quickly became familiar with navigating a complex database. She understood that our office had many fun projects, like working on our Instagram account, but that we also needed data entry tasks completed and admission letters sent out in the mail. Jennie completed each task with a smile and was willing to always search for more to do.</p>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">The entire admissions team thought Jennie was a wonderful student worker, and we would hire her to come back and work in our office again if we could.</br>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">I can't wait to see where her wonderful experiences take her as she will be a fantastic employee in any organization that is lucky enough to hire her.</br>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Sincerely, </br> Kate Snowden</br>Associate Director of Admissions </br>University of Minnesota Law School</p>

								<div class="box">
									<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;"> To Whom It May Concern: </p>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Jennie worked under my supervision as a student web developer from February 14 to May 9, 2022, and she will be returning to work after the summer break in September 2022. Her responsibilities are to help me develop and manage the customized Drupal websites I am responsible for at the University of Minnesota, including updating configurations, HTML, and CSS; managing code changes with GitHub; bug testing; and maintaining content. </p>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Our hiring committee was immediately impressed by Jennieâ€™s enthusiasm for learning new technical and design skills and the incisive questions she asked during her interview, and our initial impressions were confirmed. Jennie did not have experience with Drupal, which is infamously hard to learn, or other content management systems, and had limited HTML and CSS experience, but she was able to learn basic concepts and skills quickly by seeing demonstrations from me, taking LinkedIn Learning courses, and asking pertinent questions.</p>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We work remotely and use scaled agile methodologies to manage work, and she quickly adapted to our environment and was diligent about completing her stories and maintaining the Jira board. She even helped uncover an issue with the way we were using Jira so that we were better able to communicate.</p>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">In addition, she took responsibility for scheduling meetings with our other student web developer so they could work on some tasks together and learn from each other.</br>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">I think she will be able to quickly learn new skills and contribute to software teams. I recommend her for software engineering internships.</br>
										<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Sincerely, </br> Christina L. Goodland</br>Product Owner, Atlas and Coordinator, Accessible U </br>Office of Information Technology</br>University of Minnesota</p>
